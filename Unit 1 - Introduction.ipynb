    "# Introduction to Machine Learning through Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subject, the practice is focused on the study of different Machine Learning models. The aim is to understand how they work and how to use them to solve real-world problems. The main points to cover will be: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Artificial Neuron Networks\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines \n",
    "* Decision Trees \n",
    "* k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)\n",
    "* Ensemble Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "To cover all these concepts, the programming language Julia will be used. The latter, being a language mainly for development and research, will allow us to indeep the whole process of using the aforementioned systems.  In a first approach, in order to gain familiarity with the language, an ANN training will be implemented. This will also serve as an introduction to ANNs, their correct definition and training.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a general view, the practicum will cover two tasks in parallel: \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the first weeks, through tutorials like this one, coding tasks of different parts of a Machine Learning system, such as a cross validation or the metrics to be used, will be performed. Given that during these first weeks the degree of development of the practical application will be very restricted, the practices will take a well-known problem, the iris flower classification problem, as a benchmark.  However, as the code is developed in these tutorials, it is expected to be integrated into the final system. In other words, in each practice, a part of the final system will be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In parallel, each working team will have to carry out the tasks inherent to the problem they have set out to solve.  These tasks include data acquisition, data analysis, loading the database in Julia, etc.  As the tutorials progress, these advances must be integrated and applied to solve the problem, which will be reflected in the different memory deliverables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, during the first weeks there will be a double objective: on the one hand to learn how to implement the different parts of a machine learning system, and on the other hand to start working on the proposed practical application. For this purpose, the code that is being developed will be integrated incrementally. Once the tutorials have been completed, the work will focus solely on solving the proposed problem, using different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the iris flower problem will be used as an illustrative problem for the development of the code in the tutorials.  This is possibly the best known database in the field of pattern recognition.  This database was published by Fisher in 1936 as an example of linear discriminant analysis, and since then it has been used on many occasions as a benchmark for new systems or simply for learning. This database contains 150 instances belonging to 3 classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica. Each of these classes has 50 instances belonging only to that class giving a simple classification problem.  It should be noted that one of these classes is linearly separable from the other two, while they are not linearly separable from each other.  Each instance consists of 4 attributes, which are lengths and widths of sepals and petals, measured in centimetres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database to be used in these practices can be downloaded from the UCI website, at the following address: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/) ,specifically, the file to be downloaded is called \"iris.data\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This first tutorial aims to install and become familiar with Julia. To do so, a code will be developed to load this database in Julia and perform a basic preprocessing. This basic preprocessing has to do with the use of categorical inputs and/or outputs instead of numerical ones, and the normalisation of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the treatment of categorical values, this is a very common step, since many models such as NRs do not accept categorical inputs and outputs, but only work with numerical values. In contrast, many of the databases have categorical inputs and/or outputs rather than numerical ones. Therefore, in order for models that only accept numerical inputs and outputs to process them, it is necessary to convert these categorical values into numerical values: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are only two categories, e.g. true/false, green/blue, wood/metal or expensive/cheap, that attribute is transformed into a single attribute, which takes the value false or 0 for one category and true or 1 for the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are more than two categories, for example red/green/blue, wood/metal/plastic or car/boat/plane/train, it is transformed into as many attributes as there are possibilities, one for each category, with value 1 for those instances that belong to it and 0 for those that do not.  For example, in the red/green/blue case, the patterns with value \"red\" will become (1, 0, 0), the \"green\" ones (0, 1, 0) and the \"blue\" ones (0, 0, 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "* A third possibility, when there are more than two categories, is to convert them into a single real number.  For example, A/B/C/D could become 0/0.33/0.66/1. However, this case is only interesting when in the real world there is an order A < B < C < D, and is therefore not applicable in the case of iris flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the iris flower database, this situation occurs only in the desired output, which needs to be encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to data normalisation, training a model will be much faster if the inputs provided are on the same scale, i.e. if the model is spared from having to learn the relationship between the scales on which each attribute moves.  This process of converting the inputs so that they are all in the same range is called **normalisation** or **standarization**, and is one of the most common and important types of pre-processing.  This type of preprocessing allows a simpler model to solve more complex problems than without it, since it does not need to use part of it to learn the relationship between the scales of the input attributes.

Regarding normalisation, more is explained in theory classes, but in practice one of the following two types should be enough.  of these two types is used in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normalisation between maximum and minimum. For each attribute, it takes the lowest ($min$) and highest ($max$) values, and changes all $v$ values to pass them to the new interval $[newmin, newmax]$ as follows:<br/><br/> $$v' = \\frac{v-max}{max-min}\\times(newmax-newmin) + newmin$$ <br/>Generally, one usually moves to an interval between $[0, 1]$, which simplifies the equation to:<br/><br/> $$v' = \\frac{v-max}{max-min}$$ <br/> This type of normalisation is appropriate when you are certain that the data is bounded (both top and bottom), i.e. it is within an interval.  What you are doing is changing the interval of the data to the interval $[0, 1]$ and matching each data to its new value within the new interval.  However, if you suspect that one of these data might fall outside the interval and take an excessively high or low value, this transformation can be very harmful.  In this case, this outlier would be assigned a new value of 1 if it is excessively high, and the rest of the values would oscillate close to 0 with little difference between them. On the other hand,  the value would be 0 if it is excessively low, while the rest of the values would be close to 1 with little difference between them. If it is suspected that there may be cases like this, another kind of normalization should be chosen.\n"

For each attribute, the mean and standard deviation of all the values it takes are taken, and a simple transformation is made:<br/><br/>$$v'=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$$<br/> Thus, each attribute will have a mean ($\\mu$) of 0 and a standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of 1.

    "Generally speaking, knowledge about the nature of each attribute is often helpful in achieving models that deliver better results.  The more information about the data that is \"fed\" into the model, the better the model will perform. A good example of introducing information about the data is data normalisation.  This could be taken to the extreme and a different form of normalisation could be chosen, which is thought to be most appropriate, for each of the attributes.  This may lead to the decision, for example, to normalise an attribute \"temperature\" between maximum and minimum, while the attribute \"distance\" is normalised to mean 0. In most cases, however, one of these two normalisations is usually chosen and applied to all input attributes of the ANN. \n",

That is, if the outputs are in different intervals, the ANN has to learn this as well, so the ANN can be \"helped\" by normalising the output data.

    "In this way, the inputs (and desired outputs) that are applied to a model are no longer the original data, but the transformed ones.  Thus, once trained, a model is not ready to be passed the original data, but if data is to be applied, it will have to be transformed in the same way. For this very reason, no matter which way of normalisation is applied, it is necessary to save the  parameters used in the normalisation for each attribute (maximum and minimum or mean and standard deviation).  Similarly, if the desired output has been normalised (regression problems), the model will have learned to produce a normalised output, so it will have to be denormalised, which again means that the normalisation parameters of the desired outputs will have to be saved.  In summary, to apply new data to a model, the process will follow the next steps: \n",

    "In this last example, the desired outputs have been converted to a two-dimensional array of real values, which is useful in regression problems with several outputs.  However, in a classification problem such as iris, this line would give an error. The reason is that targets is of type `Array{Any,1}`, where each element is a `String` which cannot be directly converted to `Float32`.  This preprocess has to be always adapted for each particular problem.  For example, if it is a two-class classification problem and the file has numeric values of 0 and 1 for each class, this could be converted to boolean values with something like: \n",

    "Another option is to force a typecast by using the type itself as a function.  For example, you can specify a number to be of a particular type using something like `Float64(8)`, `Float32(8)`, `Int64(8)`, `UInt32(8)`, etc.  However, you cannot do ~~`Float64(inputs)`~~, because inputs is not of type `Number`, and therefore the conversion is not allowed.

    "One key issue that will be important in the definition of functions is a good understanding of Julia's type system. As it was already mentioned, any element, including types, are of type Any, since all types are subtypes of `Any`.  However, one must be careful with types based on others, e.g. arrays, where the elements are of a particular type. In this case, for example, a variable that is of type `Array{Float32,2}` will also be of type `Any`, but not of type `Array{AbstractFloat,2}`, Array{Real,2} nor Array{Number,2} nor Array{Any,2},  because, although Float32 is a subtype of `AbstractFloat`, `Real`, `Number` and `Any`, the type `Array{Float32,2}` is not a subtype of `Array{AbstractFloat,2}`, `Array{Real,2}`, `Array{Number,2}` or `Array{Any,2}`. To indicate whether in a type of this style its elements are subtypes of others, the `<:` operator shall be used as can be seen in the following example. This is quite useful in function definitions."

    "With respect to vectors and matrices of Boolean values, there are two types that in most cases can be used interchangeably, which are `Array{Bool,N}` and `BitArray{N}`, where N indicates the dimensionality of the array.  The `Array{Bool,N}` type stores each Boolean value as a value of type `Bool`, which is represented internally as a value of type `UInt8`. Therefore, if the array has n elements, it will need n bytes to store it. On the other hand, the `BitArray{N}` type stores each Boolean value as a bit, so n elements need n/8 bytes to be stored, a much smaller amount than the `Array{Bool,N}` type. Depending on the situation, it may be more efficient to store in one way or the other. In any case, the most common operations are defined for both types, so in the vast majority of cases they are interchangeable and therefore one or the other can be used. When defining functions, it is important to bear in mind that both are subtypes of `AbstractArray{Bool,N}`, as can be seen in the following examples:"

    "The sequence operator `:` is used in many languages as a built-in range operator, which is used to create vectors.

Generally speaking, this eliminates the need to create vectors when they are absolutely necessary, for example in loops.

For example, in Matlab in the matrix above, it is possible to give a value to an element located in a position that does not exist.  In this case, it will not give an error, opositely,  Matlab would have increased the size of the matrix up to that position, filling the new values with zeros. In Julia, however, this will cause an error, since the matrices have defined sizes similar to R.\n",

This is widely used in the operation with two-dimensional arrays, and in this subject it will be used to normalise the data. If an operation is broadcasted between a (two-dimensional) matrix and another two-dimensional matrix with a single column, both with the same number of rows, this operation will be performed as if the second matrix had the same size as the first one, with the column repeated.  The same is true if the second matrix is a one-row matrix with the same number of columns.  Of course, it makes no difference which one comes first in the operation.

To do this, the first argument is the way to initialise the data, and then a number for each dimension.  The most common way to initialise the data is to use `undef`, which indicates that you do not want to initialise the values of the array.

    "Julia has a number of functions for working with matrices such as ones, zeros, size, length, max, min, minmax, rand, inv, det, sum, etc. Some of the most commonly used are: \n",

    "- `zeros`: takes as parameters the size of each dimension, and creates an array of that dimensionality and size, where all elements are equal to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `ones`: takes as parameters the size of each dimension, and creates an array of that dimensionality and size, where all elements are equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `rand`: takes as parameters the size of each dimension, and creates an array of that dimensionality and size, where all elements are random values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `size`: receives as parameter an array and returns a tuple with as many elements as the dimensionality of the array, where each element is the size of that array.  It can be called with the dimension as a second argument, and returns only the size of that dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `maximum`: receives an array as a parameter and returns the maximum value of the array. Optionally, It also accepts a dim keyword that specifies the dimension to apply the function to. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `minimum`: performs the operation similar to maximum, but returns the minimum value instead of the maximum. It also accepts the dims keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `findall`: takes an array of boolean values as a parameter and returns the indices of the positive values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `sum`: receives as parameter an array and the sum of the values of the array. It also accepts the dims keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `mean`: takes an array as parameter and returns the average value of the array.  It also accepts the keyword dims.  Requieres a preload of  `Statistics` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `std`: takes an array as a parameter and returns the standard deviation of the values in the array.  It accepts also the keyword dims. Requieres a preload of  `Statistics` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it was pointed out, many of these functions accept the `dims` keyword to indicate along which dimension the specified operation will be performed.  If not used, this operation is performed on all elements of the array.  However, if `dims=1` is specified, this function is performed in parallel on each column, and as a result a matrix of one row and as many columns as the original matrix had will be returned. The returned value of each column will be the result of applying the function on the elements of vector formed by the column of the original matrix. \n",
    "Opositely, if `dims=2` is specified, this operation is performed in parallel on each row, and the sresults is a matrix of one column and as many rows as the original matrix. The value of each row will be the result of applying the function on the vector of elements of that row of the original matrix.For example:"
